This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(curl)     # for reading data from https
library(dplyr)    # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2)  # for plotting
```

Load the data:
```{r}
gap <- read.csv(curl("http://bit.ly/gap_data"))
head(gap)
```

Subset for EU and 1952, and plot:
```{r}
eu_52 <- gap %>% filter(continent == "Europe", year== 1952)
ggplot(data=eu_52, aes(x=gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
